### Framer Motion is now Motion for React! Read more

Quick start
Motion for React is a simple yet limitless animation library. It's the only animation library with a hybrid engine, capable of hardware accelerated animations.

It's also trusted by Framer to power its amazing no-code animations and gestures.

In this guide, we'll learn how to install Motion and take a whirlwind tour of its main features.

Install
React 18
Motion is available via npm:

npm install motion
Features can now be imported via "motion/react":

import { motion } from "motion/react"
Note: Motion for React contains APIs specifically tailored for React, but everything from vanilla Motion is also compatible and available for advanced use-cases.

React 19 / Next 15
React 19 users must currently install via the "motion" alpha branch:

npm install motion@12.0.0-alpha.2
Usage
The core of Motion for React is the <motion /> component. It's a normal DOM element, supercharged with animation capabilities.

<motion.div />
Animating a motion component is as straightforward as setting values via the animate prop:

<motion.ul animate={{ x: 100 }} />

When values in animate change, the component will animate. Motion has great-feeling defaults, but animations can of course be configured via the transition prop.

<motion.div
  animate={{
    scale: 2,
    transition: { duration: 2 }
  }}
/>
Enter animation
When a component enters the page, it will automatically animate from the rendered value, but you can provide different values via the initial prop.

<motion.button initial={{ scale: 0 }} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />

Or disable this initial animation entirely by setting initial to false.

<motion.button initial={false} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />
Gestures
<motion /> extends React's event system with powerful gesture recognises. It currently supports hover, tap, focus, and drag.

<motion.button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
  onHoverStart={() => console.log('hover started!')}
/>

Motion's gestures are designed to feel better than using CSS alone. For instance, hover events are correctly not triggered by touch screen taps. Learn more about gestures.

Scroll animations
Motion supports both types of scroll animations, scroll-triggered and scroll-linked.

To trigger an animation on scroll, the whileInView prop defines a state to animate to/from when an element enters/leaves the viewport:

<motion.div
  initial={{ backgroundColor: "rgb(0, 255, 0)", opacity: 0 }}
  whileInView={{ backgroundColor: "rgb(255, 0, 0)", opacity: 1 }}
/>

Whereas to link a value directly to scroll position, it's possible to use MotionValues via useScroll.

const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()

return <motion.div style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress }} />

Learn more about Motion's scroll animations.

Layout animations
Motion has an industry-leading layout animation engine that supports animating between changes in layout, using only transforms, between the same or different elements, with full scale correction.

It's as easy as applying the layout prop.

<motion.div layout />

Or to animate between different elements, a layoutId:

<motion.div layoutId="modal" />

Learn more about layout animations.

Exit animations
Animating elements when they're removed from the DOM is usually messy.

By wrapping motion components with <AnimatePresence> we gain access to the exit prop. 

<AnimatePresence>
  {show ? <motion.div key="box" exit={{ opacity: 0 }} /> : null}
</AnimatePresence>

Learn more about AnimatePresence.

Learn next
That's a very quick overview of Motion for React's basic features. But there's a lot more to learn! 

Next, we recommend diving further into the the <motion /> component to learn more about its powerful features, like variants. Or if you're after something more advanced, learn about MotionValues, Motion's composable values API. Timelines links

### React 19
React 19 Upgrade Guide
April 25, 2024 by Ricky Hanlon

The improvements added to React 19 require some breaking changes, but we’ve worked to make the upgrade as smooth as possible, and we don’t expect the changes to impact most apps.

Note
React 18.3 has also been published 
To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19.

We recommend upgrading to React 18.3 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.

For a list of changes in 18.3 see the Release Notes.

In this post, we will guide you through the steps for upgrading to React 19:

Installing
Codemods
Breaking changes
New deprecations
Notable changes
TypeScript changes
Changelog
If you’d like to help us test React 19, follow the steps in this upgrade guide and report any issues you encounter. For a list of new features added to React 19, see the React 19 release post.

Installing 
Note
New JSX Transform is now required 
We introduced a new JSX transform in 2020 to improve bundle size and use JSX without importing React. In React 19, we’re adding additional improvements like using ref as a prop and JSX speed improvements that require the new transform.

If the new transform is not enabled, you will see this warning:

Console
Your app (or one of its dependencies) is using an outdated JSX transform. Update to the modern JSX transform for faster performance: https://react.dev/link/new-jsx-transform
We expect most apps will not be affected since the transform is enabled in most environments already. For manual instructions on how to upgrade, please see the announcement post.

To install the latest version of React and React DOM:

npm install --save-exact react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0
Or, if you’re using Yarn:

yarn add --exact react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0
If you’re using TypeScript, you also need to update the types.

npm install --save-exact @types/react@^19.0.0 @types/react-dom@^19.0.0
Or, if you’re using Yarn:

yarn add --exact @types/react@^19.0.0 @types/react-dom@^19.0.0
We’re also including a codemod for the most common replacements. See TypeScript changes below.

Codemods 
To help with the upgrade, we’ve worked with the team at codemod.com to publish codemods that will automatically update your code to many of the new APIs and patterns in React 19.

All codemods are available in the react-codemod repo and the Codemod team have joined in helping maintain the codemods. To run these codemods, we recommend using the codemod command instead of the react-codemod because it runs faster, handles more complex code migrations, and provides better support for TypeScript.

Note
Run all React 19 codemods 
Run all codemods listed in this guide with the React 19 codemod recipe:

npx codemod@latest react/19/migration-recipe
This will run the following codemods from react-codemod:

replace-reactdom-render
replace-string-ref
replace-act-import
replace-use-form-state
prop-types-typescript
This does not include the TypeScript changes. See TypeScript changes below.

Changes that include a codemod include the command below.

For a list of all available codemods, see the react-codemod repo.

Breaking changes 
Errors in render are not re-thrown 
In previous versions of React, errors thrown during render were caught and rethrown. In DEV, we would also log to console.error, resulting in duplicate error logs.

In React 19, we’ve improved how errors are handled to reduce duplication by not re-throwing:

Uncaught Errors: Errors that are not caught by an Error Boundary are reported to window.reportError.
Caught Errors: Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error.
This change should not impact most apps, but if your production error reporting relies on errors being re-thrown, you may need to update your error handling. To support this, we’ve added new methods to createRoot and hydrateRoot for custom error handling:

const root = createRoot(container, {
  onUncaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {
    // ... log error report
  },
  onCaughtError: (error, errorInfo) => {
    // ... log error report
  }
});
For more info, see the docs for createRoot and hydrateRoot.

Removed deprecated React APIs 
Removed: propTypes and defaultProps for functions 
PropTypes were deprecated in April 2017 (v15.5.0).

In React 19, we’re removing the propType checks from the React package, and using them will be silently ignored. If you’re using propTypes, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.

We’re also removing defaultProps from function components in place of ES6 default parameters. Class components will continue to support defaultProps since there is no ES6 alternative.

// Before
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

function Heading({text}) {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>;
}
Heading.propTypes = {
  text: PropTypes.string,
};
Heading.defaultProps = {
  text: 'Hello, world!',
};
// After
interface Props {
  text?: string;
}
function Heading({text = 'Hello, world!'}: Props) {
  return <h1>{text}</h1>;
}
Note
Codemod propTypes to TypeScript with:

npx codemod@latest react/prop-types-typescript
Removed: Legacy Context using contextTypes and getChildContext 
Legacy Context was deprecated in October 2018 (v16.6.0).

Legacy Context was only available in class components using the APIs contextTypes and getChildContext, and was replaced with contextType due to subtle bugs that were easy to miss. In React 19, we’re removing Legacy Context to make React slightly smaller and faster.

If you’re still using Legacy Context in class components, you’ll need to migrate to the new contextType API:

// Before
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class Parent extends React.Component {
  static childContextTypes = {
    foo: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  };

  getChildContext() {
    return { foo: 'bar' };
  }

  render() {
    return <Child />;
  }
}

class Child extends React.Component {
  static contextTypes = {
    foo: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  };

  render() {
    return <div>{this.context.foo}</div>;
  }
}
// After
const FooContext = React.createContext();

class Parent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <FooContext value='bar'>
        <Child />
      </FooContext>
    );
  }
}

class Child extends React.Component {
  static contextType = FooContext;

  render() {
    return <div>{this.context}</div>;
  }
}
Removed: string refs 
String refs were deprecated in March, 2018 (v16.3.0).

Class components supported string refs before being replaced by ref callbacks due to multiple downsides. In React 19, we’re removing string refs to make React simpler and easier to understand.

If you’re still using string refs in class components, you’ll need to migrate to ref callbacks:

// Before
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.refs.input.focus();
  }

  render() {
    return <input ref='input' />;
  }
}
// After
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.input.focus();
  }

  render() {
    return <input ref={input => this.input = input} />;
  }
}
Note
Codemod string refs with ref callbacks:

npx codemod@latest react/19/replace-string-ref
Removed: Module pattern factories 
Module pattern factories were deprecated in August 2019 (v16.9.0).

This pattern was rarely used and supporting it causes React to be slightly larger and slower than necessary. In React 19, we’re removing support for module pattern factories, and you’ll need to migrate to regular functions:

// Before
function FactoryComponent() {
  return { render() { return <div />; } }
}
// After
function FactoryComponent() {
  return <div />;
}
Removed: React.createFactory 
createFactory was deprecated in February 2020 (v16.13.0).

Using createFactory was common before broad support for JSX, but it’s rarely used today and can be replaced with JSX. In React 19, we’re removing createFactory and you’ll need to migrate to JSX:

// Before
import { createFactory } from 'react';

const button = createFactory('button');
// After
const button = <button />;
Removed: react-test-renderer/shallow 
In React 18, we updated react-test-renderer/shallow to re-export react-shallow-renderer. In React 19, we’re removing react-test-render/shallow to prefer installing the package directly:

npm install react-shallow-renderer --save-dev
- import ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow';
+ import ShallowRenderer from 'react-shallow-renderer';
Note
Please reconsider shallow rendering 
Shallow rendering depends on React internals and can block you from future upgrades. We recommend migrating your tests to @testing-library/react or @testing-library/react-native.

Removed deprecated React DOM APIs 
Removed: react-dom/test-utils 
We’ve moved act from react-dom/test-utils to the react package:

Console
ReactDOMTestUtils.act is deprecated in favor of React.act. Import act from react instead of react-dom/test-utils. See https://react.dev/warnings/react-dom-test-utils for more info.
To fix this warning, you can import act from react:

- import {act} from 'react-dom/test-utils'
+ import {act} from 'react';
All other test-utils functions have been removed. These utilities were uncommon, and made it too easy to depend on low level implementation details of your components and React. In React 19, these functions will error when called and their exports will be removed in a future version.

See the warning page for alternatives.

Note
Codemod ReactDOMTestUtils.act to React.act:

npx codemod@latest react/19/replace-act-import
Removed: ReactDOM.render 
ReactDOM.render was deprecated in March 2022 (v18.0.0). In React 19, we’re removing ReactDOM.render and you’ll need to migrate to using ReactDOM.createRoot:

// Before
import {render} from 'react-dom';
render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// After
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
Note
Codemod ReactDOM.render to ReactDOMClient.createRoot:

npx codemod@latest react/19/replace-reactdom-render
Removed: ReactDOM.hydrate 
ReactDOM.hydrate was deprecated in March 2022 (v18.0.0). In React 19, we’re removing ReactDOM.hydrate you’ll need to migrate to using ReactDOM.hydrateRoot,

// Before
import {hydrate} from 'react-dom';
hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// After
import {hydrateRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('root'), <App />);
Note
Codemod ReactDOM.hydrate to ReactDOMClient.hydrateRoot:

npx codemod@latest react/19/replace-reactdom-render
Removed: unmountComponentAtNode 
ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode was deprecated in March 2022 (v18.0.0). In React 19, you’ll need to migrate to using root.unmount().

// Before
unmountComponentAtNode(document.getElementById('root'));

// After
root.unmount();
For more see root.unmount() for createRoot and hydrateRoot.

Note
Codemod unmountComponentAtNode to root.unmount:

npx codemod@latest react/19/replace-reactdom-render
Removed: ReactDOM.findDOMNode 
ReactDOM.findDOMNode was deprecated in October 2018 (v16.6.0).

We’re removing findDOMNode because it was a legacy escape hatch that was slow to execute, fragile to refactoring, only returned the first child, and broke abstraction levels (see more here). You can replace ReactDOM.findDOMNode with DOM refs:

// Before
import {findDOMNode} from 'react-dom';

function AutoselectingInput() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const input = findDOMNode(this);
    input.select()
  }, []);

  return <input defaultValue="Hello" />;
}
// After
function AutoselectingInput() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current.select();
  }, []);

  return <input ref={ref} defaultValue="Hello" />
}
New deprecations 
Deprecated: element.ref 
React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating the element.ref in place of element.props.ref.

Accessing element.ref will warn:

Console
Accessing element.ref is no longer supported. ref is now a regular prop. It will be removed from the JSX Element type in a future release.
Deprecated: react-test-renderer 
We are deprecating react-test-renderer because it implements its own renderer environment that doesn’t match the environment users use, promotes testing implementation details, and relies on introspection of React’s internals.

The test renderer was created before there were more viable testing strategies available like React Testing Library, and we now recommend using a modern testing library instead.

In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning, and has switched to concurrent rendering. We recommend migrating your tests to @testing-library/react or @testing-library/react-native for a modern and well supported testing experience.

Notable changes 
StrictMode changes 
React 19 includes several fixes and improvements to Strict Mode.

When double rendering in Strict Mode in development, useMemo and useCallback will reuse the memoized results from the first render during the second render. Components that are already Strict Mode compatible should not notice a difference in behavior.

As with all Strict Mode behaviors, these features are designed to proactively surface bugs in your components during development so you can fix them before they are shipped to production. For example, during development, Strict Mode will double-invoke ref callback functions on initial mount, to simulate what happens when a mounted component is replaced by a Suspense fallback.

Improvements to Suspense 
In React 19, when a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React schedules another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests in the rest of the tree:

Diagram showing a tree of three components, one parent labeled Accordion and two children labeled Panel. Both Panel components contain isActive with value false.
Previously, when a component suspended, the suspended siblings were rendered and then the fallback was committed.

The same diagram as the previous, with the isActive of the first child Panel component highlighted indicating a click with the isActive value set to true. The second Panel component still contains value false.
In React 19, when a component suspends, the fallback is committed and then the suspended siblings are rendered.

This change means Suspense fallbacks display faster, while still warming lazy requests in the suspended tree.

UMD builds removed 
UMD was widely used in the past as a convenient way to load React without a build step. Now, there are modern alternatives for loading modules as scripts in HTML documents. Starting with React 19, React will no longer produce UMD builds to reduce the complexity of its testing and release process.

To load React 19 with a script tag, we recommend using an ESM-based CDN such as esm.sh.

<script type="module">
  import React from "https://esm.sh/react@19/?dev"
  import ReactDOMClient from "https://esm.sh/react-dom@19/client?dev"
  ...
</script>
Libraries depending on React internals may block upgrades 
This release includes changes to React internals that may impact libraries that ignore our pleas to not use internals like SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED. These changes are necessary to land improvements in React 19, and will not break libraries that follow our guidelines.

Based on our Versioning Policy, these updates are not listed as breaking changes, and we are not including docs for how to upgrade them. The recommendation is to remove any code that depends on internals.

To reflect the impact of using internals, we have renamed the SECRET_INTERNALS suffix to:

_DO_NOT_USE_OR_WARN_USERS_THEY_CANNOT_UPGRADE

In the future we will more aggressively block accessing internals from React to discourage usage and ensure users are not blocked from upgrading.

TypeScript changes 
Removed deprecated TypeScript types 
We’ve cleaned up the TypeScript types based on the removed APIs in React 19. Some of the removed have types been moved to more relevant packages, and others are no longer needed to describe React’s behavior.

Note
We’ve published types-react-codemod to migrate most type related breaking changes:

npx types-react-codemod@latest preset-19 ./path-to-app
If you have a lot of unsound access to element.props, you can run this additional codemod:

npx types-react-codemod@latest react-element-default-any-props ./path-to-your-react-ts-files
Check out types-react-codemod for a list of supported replacements. If you feel a codemod is missing, it can be tracked in the list of missing React 19 codemods.

ref cleanups required 
This change is included in the react-19 codemod preset as no-implicit-ref-callback-return .

Due to the introduction of ref cleanup functions, returning anything else from a ref callback will now be rejected by TypeScript. The fix is usually to stop using implicit returns:

- <div ref={current => (instance = current)} />
+ <div ref={current => {instance = current}} />
The original code returned the instance of the HTMLDivElement and TypeScript wouldn’t know if this was supposed to be a cleanup function or not.

useRef requires an argument 
This change is included in the react-19 codemod preset as refobject-defaults.

A long-time complaint of how TypeScript and React work has been useRef. We’ve changed the types so that useRef now requires an argument. This significantly simplifies its type signature. It’ll now behave more like createContext.

// @ts-expect-error: Expected 1 argument but saw none
useRef();
// Passes
useRef(undefined);
// @ts-expect-error: Expected 1 argument but saw none
createContext();
// Passes
createContext(undefined);
This now also means that all refs are mutable. You’ll no longer hit the issue where you can’t mutate a ref because you initialised it with null:

const ref = useRef<number>(null);

// Cannot assign to 'current' because it is a read-only property
ref.current = 1;
MutableRef is now deprecated in favor of a single RefObject type which useRef will always return:

interface RefObject<T> {
  current: T
}

declare function useRef<T>: RefObject<T>
useRef still has a convenience overload for useRef<T>(null) that automatically returns RefObject<T | null>. To ease migration due to the required argument for useRef, a convenience overload for useRef(undefined) was added that automatically returns RefObject<T | undefined>.

Check out [RFC] Make all refs mutable for prior discussions about this change.

Changes to the ReactElement TypeScript type 
This change is included in the react-element-default-any-props codemod.

The props of React elements now default to unknown instead of any if the element is typed as ReactElement. This does not affect you if you pass a type argument to ReactElement:

type Example2 = ReactElement<{ id: string }>["props"];
//   ^? { id: string }
But if you relied on the default, you now have to handle unknown:

type Example = ReactElement["props"];
//   ^? Before, was 'any', now 'unknown'
You should only need it if you have a lot of legacy code relying on unsound access of element props. Element introspection only exists as an escape hatch, and you should make it explicit that your props access is unsound via an explicit any.

The JSX namespace in TypeScript 
This change is included in the react-19 codemod preset as scoped-jsx

A long-time request is to remove the global JSX namespace from our types in favor of React.JSX. This helps prevent pollution of global types which prevents conflicts between different UI libraries that leverage JSX.

You’ll now need to wrap module augmentation of the JSX namespace in `declare module ”…”:

// global.d.ts
+ declare module "react" {
    namespace JSX {
      interface IntrinsicElements {
        "my-element": {
          myElementProps: string;
        };
      }
    }
+ }
The exact module specifier depends on the JSX runtime you specified in the compilerOptions of your tsconfig.json:

For "jsx": "react-jsx" it would be react/jsx-runtime.
For "jsx": "react-jsxdev" it would be react/jsx-dev-runtime.
For "jsx": "react" and "jsx": "preserve" it would be react.
Better useReducer typings 
useReducer now has improved type inference thanks to @mfp22.

However, this required a breaking change where useReducer doesn’t accept the full reducer type as a type parameter but instead either needs none (and rely on contextual typing) or needs both the state and action type.

The new best practice is not to pass type arguments to useReducer.

- useReducer<React.Reducer<State, Action>>(reducer)
+ useReducer(reducer)
This may not work in edge cases where you can explicitly type the state and action, by passing in the Action in a tuple:

- useReducer<React.Reducer<State, Action>>(reducer)
+ useReducer<State, [Action]>(reducer)
If you define the reducer inline, we encourage to annotate the function parameters instead:

- useReducer<React.Reducer<State, Action>>((state, action) => state)
+ useReducer((state: State, action: Action) => state)
This is also what you’d also have to do if you move the reducer outside of the useReducer call:

const reducer = (state: State, action: Action) => state;

### React compiler
React Compiler
This page will give you an introduction to React Compiler and how to try it out successfully.

Under Construction
These docs are still a work in progress. More documentation is available in the React Compiler Working Group repo, and will be upstreamed into these docs when they are more stable.

You will learn
Getting started with the compiler
Installing the compiler and ESLint plugin
Troubleshooting
Note
React Compiler is a new compiler currently in Beta, that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the Rules of React.

The latest Beta release can be found with the @beta tag, and daily experimental releases with @experimental.

React Compiler is a new compiler that we’ve open sourced to get early feedback from the community. It is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. It works with plain JavaScript, and understands the Rules of React, so you don’t need to rewrite any code to use it.

The compiler also includes an ESLint plugin that surfaces the analysis from the compiler right in your editor. We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today. The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it even if you are not ready to try out the compiler.

The compiler is currently released as beta, and is available to try out on React 17+ apps and libraries. To install the Beta:

 Terminal
 Copy
npm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@beta eslint-plugin-react-compiler@beta
Or, if you’re using Yarn:

 Terminal
 Copy
yarn add -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@beta eslint-plugin-react-compiler@beta
If you are not using React 19 yet, please see the section below for further instructions.

What does the compiler do? 
In order to optimize applications, React Compiler automatically memoizes your code. You may be familiar today with memoization through APIs such as useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo. With these APIs you can tell React that certain parts of your application don’t need to recompute if their inputs haven’t changed, reducing work on updates. While powerful, it’s easy to forget to apply memoization or apply them incorrectly. This can lead to inefficient updates as React has to check parts of your UI that don’t have any meaningful changes.

The compiler uses its knowledge of JavaScript and React’s rules to automatically memoize values or groups of values within your components and hooks. If it detects breakages of the rules, it will automatically skip over just those components or hooks, and continue safely compiling other code.

Note
React Compiler can statically detect when Rules of React are broken, and safely opt-out of optimizing just the affected components or hooks. It is not necessary for the compiler to optimize 100% of your codebase.

If your codebase is already very well-memoized, you might not expect to see major performance improvements with the compiler. However, in practice memoizing the correct dependencies that cause performance issues is tricky to get right by hand.

Deep Dive
What kind of memoization does React Compiler add? 

Show Details
Should I try out the compiler? 
Please note that the compiler is still in Beta and has many rough edges. While it has been used in production at companies like Meta, rolling out the compiler to production for your app will depend on the health of your codebase and how well you’ve followed the Rules of React.

You don’t have to rush into using the compiler now. It’s okay to wait until it reaches a stable release before adopting it. However, we do appreciate trying it out in small experiments in your apps so that you can provide feedback to us to help make the compiler better.

Getting Started 
In addition to these docs, we recommend checking the React Compiler Working Group for additional information and discussion about the compiler.

Installing eslint-plugin-react-compiler 
React Compiler also powers an ESLint plugin. The ESLint plugin can be used independently of the compiler, meaning you can use the ESLint plugin even if you don’t use the compiler.

 Terminal
 Copy
npm install -D eslint-plugin-react-compiler@beta
Then, add it to your ESLint config:

import reactCompiler from 'eslint-plugin-react-compiler'

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      'react-compiler': reactCompiler,
    },
    rules: {
      'react-compiler/react-compiler': 'error',
    },
  },
]
Or, in the deprecated eslintrc config format:

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'eslint-plugin-react-compiler',
  ],
  rules: {
    'react-compiler/react-compiler': 'error',
  },
}
The ESLint plugin will display any violations of the rules of React in your editor. When it does this, it means that the compiler has skipped over optimizing that component or hook. This is perfectly okay, and the compiler can recover and continue optimizing other components in your codebase.

Note
You don’t have to fix all ESLint violations straight away. You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized, but it is not required to fix everything before you can use the compiler.

Rolling out the compiler to your codebase 
Existing projects 
The compiler is designed to compile functional components and hooks that follow the Rules of React. It can also handle code that breaks those rules by bailing out (skipping over) those components or hooks. However, due to the flexible nature of JavaScript, the compiler cannot catch every possible violation and may compile with false negatives: that is, the compiler may accidentally compile a component/hook that breaks the Rules of React which can lead to undefined behavior.

For this reason, to adopt the compiler successfully on existing projects, we recommend running it on a small directory in your product code first. You can do this by configuring the compiler to only run on a specific set of directories:

const ReactCompilerConfig = {
  sources: (filename) => {
    return filename.indexOf('src/path/to/dir') !== -1;
  },
};
When you have more confidence with rolling out the compiler, you can expand coverage to other directories as well and slowly roll it out to your whole app.

New projects 
If you’re starting a new project, you can enable the compiler on your entire codebase, which is the default behavior.

Using React Compiler with React 17 or 18 
React Compiler works best with React 19 RC. If you are unable to upgrade, you can install the extra react-compiler-runtime package which will allow the compiled code to run on versions prior to 19. However, note that the minimum supported version is 17.

 Terminal
 Copy
npm install react-compiler-runtime@beta
You should also add the correct target to your compiler config, where target is the major version of React you are targeting:

// babel.config.js
const ReactCompilerConfig = {
  target: '18' // '17' | '18' | '19'
};

module.exports = function () {
  return {
    plugins: [
      ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', ReactCompilerConfig],
    ],
  };
};
Using the compiler on libraries 
React Compiler can also be used to compile libraries. Because React Compiler needs to run on the original source code prior to any code transformations, it is not possible for an application’s build pipeline to compile the libraries they use. Hence, our recommendation is for library maintainers to independently compile and test their libraries with the compiler, and ship compiled code to npm.

Because your code is pre-compiled, users of your library will not need to have the compiler enabled in order to benefit from the automatic memoization applied to your library. If your library targets apps not yet on React 19, specify a minimum target and add react-compiler-runtime as a direct dependency. The runtime package will use the correct implementation of APIs depending on the application’s version, and polyfill the missing APIs if necessary.

Library code can often require more complex patterns and usage of escape hatches. For this reason, we recommend ensuring that you have sufficient testing in order to identify any issues that might arise from using the compiler on your library. If you identify any issues, you can always opt-out the specific components or hooks with the 'use no memo' directive.

Similarly to apps, it is not necessary to fully compile 100% of your components or hooks to see benefits in your library. A good starting point might be to identify the most performance sensitive parts of your library and ensuring that they don’t break the Rules of React, which you can use eslint-plugin-react-compiler to identify.

Usage 
Babel 
 Terminal
 Copy
npm install babel-plugin-react-compiler@beta
The compiler includes a Babel plugin which you can use in your build pipeline to run the compiler.

After installing, add it to your Babel config. Please note that it’s critical that the compiler run first in the pipeline:

// babel.config.js
const ReactCompilerConfig = { /* ... */ };

module.exports = function () {
  return {
    plugins: [
      ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', ReactCompilerConfig], // must run first!
      // ...
    ],
  };
};
babel-plugin-react-compiler should run first before other Babel plugins as the compiler requires the input source information for sound analysis.

Vite 
If you use Vite, you can add the plugin to vite-plugin-react:

// vite.config.js
const ReactCompilerConfig = { /* ... */ };

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      react({
        babel: {
          plugins: [
            ["babel-plugin-react-compiler", ReactCompilerConfig],
          ],
        },
      }),
    ],
    // ...
  };
});
Next.js 
Please refer to the Next.js docs for more information.

Remix 
Install vite-plugin-babel, and add the compiler’s Babel plugin to it:

 Terminal
 Copy
npm install vite-plugin-babel
// vite.config.js
import babel from "vite-plugin-babel";

const ReactCompilerConfig = { /* ... */ };

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({ /* ... */}),
    babel({
      filter: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
      babelConfig: {
        presets: ["@babel/preset-typescript"], // if you use TypeScript
        plugins: [
          ["babel-plugin-react-compiler", ReactCompilerConfig],
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
Webpack 
A community Webpack loader is now available here.

Expo 
Please refer to Expo’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Expo apps.

Metro (React Native) 
React Native uses Babel via Metro, so refer to the Usage with Babel section for installation instructions.

Rspack 
Please refer to Rspack’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Rspack apps.

Rsbuild 
Please refer to Rsbuild’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Rsbuild apps.

Troubleshooting 
To report issues, please first create a minimal repro on the React Compiler Playground and include it in your bug report. You can open issues in the facebook/react repo.

You can also provide feedback in the React Compiler Working Group by applying to be a member. Please see the README for more details on joining.

What does the compiler assume? 
React Compiler assumes that your code:

Is valid, semantic JavaScript.
Tests that nullable/optional values and properties are defined before accessing them (for example, by enabling strictNullChecks if using TypeScript), i.e., if (object.nullableProperty) { object.nullableProperty.foo } or with optional-chaining object.nullableProperty?.foo.
Follows the Rules of React.
React Compiler can verify many of the Rules of React statically, and will safely skip compilation when it detects an error. To see the errors we recommend also installing eslint-plugin-react-compiler.

How do I know my components have been optimized? 
React Devtools (v5.0+) has built-in support for React Compiler and will display a “Memo ✨” badge next to components that have been optimized by the compiler.

Something is not working after compilation 
If you have eslint-plugin-react-compiler installed, the compiler will display any violations of the rules of React in your editor. When it does this, it means that the compiler has skipped over optimizing that component or hook. This is perfectly okay, and the compiler can recover and continue optimizing other components in your codebase. You don’t have to fix all ESLint violations straight away. You can address them at your own pace to increase the amount of components and hooks being optimized.

Due to the flexible and dynamic nature of JavaScript however, it’s not possible to comprehensively detect all cases. Bugs and undefined behavior such as infinite loops may occur in those cases.

If your app doesn’t work properly after compilation and you aren’t seeing any ESLint errors, the compiler may be incorrectly compiling your code. To confirm this, try to make the issue go away by aggressively opting out any component or hook you think might be related via the "use no memo" directive.

function SuspiciousComponent() {
  "use no memo"; // opts out this component from being compiled by React Compiler
  // ...
}
Note
"use no memo" 
"use no memo" is a temporary escape hatch that lets you opt-out components and hooks from being compiled by the React Compiler. This directive is not meant to be long lived the same way as eg "use client" is.

It is not recommended to reach for this directive unless it’s strictly necessary. Once you opt-out a component or hook, it is opted-out forever until the directive is removed. This means that even if you fix the code, the compiler will still skip over compiling it unless you remove the directive.

When you make the error go away, confirm that removing the opt out directive makes the issue come back. Then share a bug report with us (you can try to reduce it to a small repro, or if it’s open source code you can also just paste the entire source) using the React Compiler Playground so we can identify and help fix the issue.
